Hello, this is one of my solo projects and this one is a project for Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles in Fall 2020 under the name of drinks ordering. 

The app works as a drinks order taker for a boba restaurant that allow the customer to customize ice and sugars and order multiple drinks at the same time. The video is a demo of how the program should work.
